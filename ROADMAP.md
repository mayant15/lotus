# Roadmap

## Wishlist

### Physics
- Transform as a matrix/rotation as a quaternion.
 
### Serialization and UI
- For effective saving/loading scenes, binding components to editor panels etc etc
- UI markup? Have a "ImGUILang" parser on the editor side that reads an ImGUILang file for each module that has UI elements, maybe autogenerated by CMake.
- Can be used for custom editor gizmos
  
### Modules, Plugins and General Architecture
- Rethink module structure. Plugins vs modules? Try [cr](https://github.com/fungos/cr) for hot reloading?
  - EnTT 3.6 makes breaking changes. Module and a central `type_context` in the engine is important before I bump the version.
  - EnTT 3.6 (3.7 now) will make diffing and serialization simpler I think. Need more research.
- Engine modules for rendering, resources, physics etc. These would each be separate DLLs. The game itself would be a module (see Godot)
- Split simulation and rendering threads
  - Single tick or independent ticks? I would prefer to go for single tick, but then we'll have to synchronize each frame.
  - FixedUpdate vs Update for physics and rendering
  
### Rendering
- Low-level render library to interface with various graphics APIs like Vulkan, OpenGL etc. (or just use Vulkan everywhere?)
- Deferred rendering
- Shadows and reflections
- Importer tool to import an asset into the engine and store it with all required metadata in an optimized format

### Registry diffs and Undo/Redo

#### Need
- Registry diffs. Need to maintain a diff between current scene and scene on disk, and also between simulating scene vs current scene.
- Will be beneficial when I pass modified values across threads.
- Component diffs are also required to pass changes across physics systems
- Undo/Redo system for UI

#### Options

1. Clear the scene, reload the scene from file
1. Reload the changed entities from file
1. Undo the changed entities

To get a notification on changed entities: need a SaveComponent() type API otherwise notifications would not be triggered.
To reload changed entities, from file is not that good of an option. Keep them compressed in memory?

#### Plan

1. ~~Have a PatchComponent() API~~
1. Use entt::observer and other hooks to register changes to entities or components
1. Have EntityDiffUtil and ComponentDiffUtil classes that register these changes, keeping only initial and final values
1. Have hooks into these util classes for the Undo/Redo system, which uses these classes to maintain its own undo/redo stacks

### Other Features
- ~~Engine play button for testing the game in editor~~
- Build tool to create no-editor builds of the game. Have a couple of stub files that implement the runtime and use CMake scripts
  to build and link it with the engine and the game DLL
- More unit tests
- Precompiled headers
