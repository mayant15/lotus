### Non-Code Contributions

- **Documentation:** The project is still pretty new, so there is a lot of scope for improvement in our documentation.
- **Bug reports:** If you encounter a bug, or want to request a feature, or something doesn't work the way that you would expect it to, please file a report. We want Lotus to "just work".
