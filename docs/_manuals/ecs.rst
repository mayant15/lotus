Entity Component System
===========================

At its core, Lotus uses a standard Entity Component System architecture, implemented via `EnTT <https://github.com/skypjack/entt/>`_.
On top of this, Lotus provides a few classes to create an "object-oriented" structure over plain entities, for easier access to functionality.
