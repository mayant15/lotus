Lotus Documentation - Latest
=================================

Welcome to the documentation for Lotus, a cross-platform 3D game engine. The documentation is organized into two broad sections:
the user manual and the API reference. The manual contains tutorials and general information, and the API reference contains
autogenerated help text for the engine C++ API.

.. WARNING::
   Lotus is still pretty much in active development, and therefore the documentation is aimed towards developers of the engine.
